<h2>Greentwix</h2>

<p align="right">Life is full of little surprises. &mdash;
Pandora</p>

<p align="justify">Stormy summer night... A man walking down the
street sees all things shaped and shaded unearthly, some of them
are so vague that seem to have no nature. A rare passer-by resembles
an ugly faceless humanoid.</p>

<p align="justify">Occasionally the man hears in the air a series
of orders. He must go somewhere. He goes, yet scarcely knows the
aim, and sees a stranger approaching... The new order - "touch
him"... With an object suddenly appeared in his hand he slightly
touches the stranger causing a quick metamorphosis. Another
townsman has just become a zombie. The man goes further...
Something eerie is bound to happen, and... A huge lightning dazzles
us, then absolute blackness and a roll of thunder in a
distance...</p>

<p align="justify">Incredible as it may seem, our hero has
survived. He woke up in his bed and saw the usual ambience in
daylight. A woman seated beside the bed. She told him what has
happened: "You were struck by a lightning this night. The doctors
are great deal puzzled that you were not killed or just injured. I
live in the neighborhood, third house to the right. Stayed here to
see to you till you're all right, so, suppose, I can go now."</p>

<p align="justify">So the game begins. The whole story takes place
in the small town Greentwix where our hero lives. He is a
photographer of the local newspaper Querty. Besides him we will
meet some other characters in the town: beggar, policeman, barrow
boy, yard-keeper etc. A lunatic sitting near the church would
sometimes provide important knowledge in the form of apocalyptic
warnings.</p>

<p align="justify">The town consists of a few dwelling houses,
Querty editorial office, police station, church and the office of
"Astindaz" brewer company. On the outskirts of the town one would
find a town dump, electric distribution station and a small
cemetery. Quite a complicated sewerage system is hidden beneath the
ground. Only one road runs across the town and you can rarely see a
car or truck passing by.</p>

<p align="justify">On the whole, the plot of the game is straight.
It consists of some key events, first of them is a strike of
lightning, all others the hero will inevitably go through.
Nevertheless, the hero is free to investigate the area, communicate
with other personages and fulfill intermediate tasks in any order.
In other words, many various ways exist to achieve the same
objects. In the course of the game the hero should solve a riddle
of strange mutations the inhabitants of the town undergo, find out
a way how to stop these mutations, and finally eliminate the source
of this menace.</p>
